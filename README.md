# Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing pyrat2.py
2. Run 'python3 pyrat2.py ai.py <ai2.py>'
2.bis Note that on many systems, python is by default python3 and thus 'python pyrat2.py ai.py <ai2.py>' is enough

The second ai argument ('ai2.py') is optionnal and can be omitted.

Parameters of the game can be directly modified by changing the file 'parameters.py'

# Install

To be able to run, one should only need python3 and pygame for python3

On Ubuntu, a typical installation would be:

sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
sudo easy_install3 pip
sudo pip3.5 install pygame
